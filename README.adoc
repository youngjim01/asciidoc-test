= asciidoc-test

This is just a simple test to try to get the rendered html from this asciidoc source to display colored text.

https://asciidoc-py.github.io/asciidoc.css-embedded.html provides multiple examples of text styling.
Here's the source:
---- 
[red]#Obvious# and [big red yellow-background]*very obvious*.

[underline]#Underline text#, [overline]#overline text# and
[blue line-through]*bold blue and line-through*.
---- 

Here it is again.  I expect that all the styling should be rendered, but none of the colors show:

[red]#Obvious# and [big red yellow-background]*very obvious*.

[underline]#Underline text#, [overline]#overline text# and
[blue line-through]*bold blue and line-through*.
